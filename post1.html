                <h1>Kickstarting My Web App Development: Speedrunning with ChatGPT-4o</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone! I'm excited to share the beginning of my journey into web app development backed by ChatGPT-4o. As a
                    software engineer, I've always been fascinated by the potential of new technologies to streamline
                    processes and create impactful solutions. Today, I want to talk about my latest project, MyAdvisor, a
                    platform designed to help users find financial advisors and allow advisors to register and attract
                    new clients. With the help of ChatGPT, specifically the GPT-4o model, I've been able to speedrun the
                    initial stages of development. Let me take you through my experience and some key insights I've
                    gained along the way.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Concept of MyAdvisor</h2>

                <h3>The Idea Behind MyAdvisor</h3>
                <p>The idea for MyAdvisor came from recognizing a common challenge that many people face. I noticed how
                    difficult it was for individuals to find reliable financial advice without spending hours on
                    research. MyAdvisor aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly platform where users can
                    easily connect with certified financial advisors. Advisors, in turn, get a streamlined way to reach
                    potential clients. The vision was clear, but the challenge was to bring this idea to life as quickly
                    and efficiently as possible.</p>

                <h3>First Step: Defining the MVP Functional Requisites</h3>
                <p>The first step in my speedrunning journey was to define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) functional
                    requirements. With a tight timeline in mind, I turned to ChatGPT-4o for guidance. It was like having
                    an expert on call 24/7, ready to provide insights and recommendations. I briefly described the kind
                    of app I wanted to build and here’s the answer that really helped shape my approach:</p>

                <p>With this invaluable advice, I was able to outline the essential functionalities that MyAdvisor
                    needed at launch. This included user registration, advisor profiles, search and filter capabilities,
                    and a secure messaging system. Knowing exactly what to focus on saved me an immense amount of time.

                <h2>Building the Foundation with ChatGPT</h2>

                <h3>Database Definition</h3>
                <p>Once the MVP was clearly defined, the next step was to design the database schema. This is where
                    things got really exciting. Using ChatGPT, I was able to draft an initial schema that includes
                    tables for users, advisors, appointments, reviews, and messages. Imagine having an assistant that
                    not only understands your vision but can also help you translate it into a structured plan.</p>
                <p>The database schema quickly took shape with ChatGPT's guidance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Users:</strong> Stores basic user information such as name, email, password (encrypted),
                        and user role (client or advisor).</li>
                    <li><strong>Advisors:</strong> Contains advisor-specific details like certifications, areas of
                        expertise, and availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appointments:</strong> Tracks booking details between users and advisors, including
                        date, time, and status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Holds user reviews and ratings for advisors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Manages the secure communication between users and advisors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This step was crucial, and having ChatGPT to bounce ideas off made it feel less daunting. It was like
                    having a seasoned co-developer by my side, ensuring I didn't miss any critical elements.</p>

                <h3>Backend API Definition</h3>
                <p>With the database schema ready, it was time to move on to defining the backend API. This part of the
                    process felt like a thrilling race against time, and ChatGPT-4 was my pit crew, providing the tools
                    and strategies needed to keep up the pace.</p>
                <p>The API is the backbone of MyAdvisor, enabling seamless interactions between the front end and the
                    database. Instead of diving into specific endpoints, ChatGPT helped me understand the overall
                    structure and best practices for creating a robust and scalable API. This included guidance on how
                    to handle user authentication, data retrieval and updating, and secure communication between users
                    and advisors.</p>
                <p>Every step of the way, ChatGPT was there to ensure that I was on the right track, providing code
                    snippets, troubleshooting advice, and even suggesting best practices. This accelerated my
                    development process immensely. I found myself making rapid progress, something that would have taken
                    me weeks or even months on my own.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Starting my journey with MyAdvisor has been incredibly rewarding, and leveraging the power of
                    ChatGPT-4 has significantly accelerated the process. From defining MVP functional requisites to
                    implementing core features and planning for scalability, GPT-4 has been an invaluable tool. As I
                    continue to develop and refine MyAdvisor, I’m excited about the possibilities and the positive
                    impact it will have on both users and financial advisors.</p>
                <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates and insights as MyAdvisor
                    evolves. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!</p>
